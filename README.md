## ServeMyCustomer

ServeMyCustomer is a SAAS application which helps product companies to serve the customer requests by providing pluggable realtime chat engine between customers and companies.

Companies can register at ServeMyCustomer website and get the Javascript snippet to be placed on their website. When a company places the ServeMyCustomer Javascript snippet on a website, it immediately adds a real time chat feature to the webpage. As a result, a chat bubble will appear on the bottom right corner of the page.

When a customer visits the company's website, clicks on the chat bubble, the chat bubble opens a chat widget after receiving the customerâ€™s name, email and subject of the conversation. 
The chat connects the customer with a person from customer support team.
